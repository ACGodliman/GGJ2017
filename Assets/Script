*birds singing*  
(You should be able to grab something from a sound library for this…blackbird maybe? Good and distinct enough to not be mistaken for white noise).


“All right children, put your hands up if you want blue paper for your lantern, I see one, two, three, four. Now who wants purple?” 
(Far away from mic)


*child sounds*


“We turned out all the lights, from torch to lamp to artificial sun, they turned out all the lights. ” 
(More than one voice here maybe?)


“I didn’t like it, the sky being broken” 
(repeating and disintegrating maybe?)


“I see you passing through here, there isn’t much left to look at now, and most of the rest are blind anyway, but I see you little ship.” 
(voice A)


“There’s a little heart still beating on The Tabor, I still hear it going tap tap tap, a little strength, a little power.” 
(Power cell location!...needs work)


“Hello?.....hello?...hello?”  
(etc, good to have a few be creepy ja?)


“Would you send a letter for us little ship? There is an envelope on The Shawm, the edges are a little torn but it still holds a letter, you can even keep it if you like.” 
(Transmitter location voice A)
